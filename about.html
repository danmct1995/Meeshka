  <h1>About the Summer Art Program </h1>
  <p>
    This program gives students the freedom to explore their creative interests and work outside the box finding that happy medium where they can have fun, learn new things and
    create work they really love. Students are encouraged to come with their own ideas of work they would like to do while being ready to try new things they may not have done before. </p>
  </br>
  <p>
    Throughout the week we discuss what it means to critique art and what words are most beneficial when discussing artwork. This helps to prepare them for the mini art show at the end of every week. On the last day, students hang all their work in the gallery and present it to the group which includes, other artists from the building, family, and friends. This is a great way for them to practice public speaking and talking about their art. They are asked to discuss their process, what materials they
    used, what worked and didn’t work for them. They show us what their favorite pieces are and then take any questions from the audience. At the end of the week, they take all their work home in their own portfolio provided by the program. </p>

  <h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>

    <button class="accordion-odd">Can my child attend the program for select days out of the week? </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>No, the program is weekly sign ups only.
    </p>
  </div>
  
    <button class="accordion">Do you have a cancellation policy?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Yes, we offer refunds, excluding the $50 deposit, for any cancellations on balances paid in full. Depending on when you cancel will determine the amount of your refund. Please <a href="mailto:meeshkaart@gmail.com"> contact Michelle </a> for more information. </i>
    </p>
  </div>
  

  <button class="accordion-odd">Do you offer transport to and from the program?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The MFA Summer Program does not offer transportation BUT we do recommend a wonderful,
local transportation service provided by Rozki Rides.  Please contact Rozki Rides directly at: (413) 314-3154, 
      <a href="https://rozkirides.com/" target="https://rozkirides.com/"> Rozkirides.com </a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RozkiRides/" target="https://www.facebook.com/RozkiRides/"> Facebook </a>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Do you have a policy for disruptive behavior for students who attend the program? </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Yes, there is a zero tolerance behavior policy to ensure that all participants get the most from the program. Every student and parent must read, discuss and sign the policy, <u> which can be found on the registration form</u>, before they can participate
      in the program.
      <br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion-odd">Are parents allowed to attend or visit during the day? </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Yes and no. Parents are always welcome but we encourage parents to hold off until the final day of the program when we will invite family and friends to attend the students' mini art show. The program is designed to give students an independence to think and grow outside of their comfort zone.  In my experience children work differently when they are on their own among their peers. I find giving them freedom to express themselves in a group setting really benefits their artwork and development as an artist.
</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion"> Can students bring their cell phones to the program?
 </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Yes they can bring their phones, which will be turned to silent and only to be used at designated times during the day. If you ever need to get in touch with your child you can always call Michelle at (413) 563-7405.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion-odd">Can you describe a typical day at the MFA Summer Program?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Drop offs start at 9am and at 9:15 we start the day with our morning meeting where we have icebreakers and team building activities and discuss the plan for the day. Next we will have an introduction to the new project we will be working on and then art
      time.
  Around 11:15 we will break and have clean up to get ready for lunch which will be from 11:45-12:30. Lunch is usually taken outside in a picnic area at the mill or at Myrtle Street park across from the mill. Students are able to have free
      time and get wet in the spray park at Myrtle Street Park weather permitting. After lunch we will have more art time, working on a new project or one we’ve already started. There will be days where we will tour the space of another resident artist
      at the mill and get a demonstration of what they do. Clean up is around 1:30PM and pick-ups begin promptly at 2:00PM.
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Do you have any after hour’s activities for students who can’t get picked up at 2:30?  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>No, unfortunately we cannot offer any after program activities for students. Parents need to make arrangements to have their child picked up at 2:30. There will be a charge for late pick-ups.
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion-odd">What should my child wear to the summer program? </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Students should always wear clothes that are ok to get stained and messy. We cannot be held responsible for students clothing or footwear getting ruined. Even though aprons are provided it does not guarantee their clothes will be kept clean. Other
      than that students can wear whatever they want. If they will want to get wet at the spray park they can bring a towel, bathing suit or a change of clothes on sunny days.
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What should my child bring for lunch?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Students should pack a cold lunch with ice packs. Students can also bring snacks and a drink. Water will be available for students and bringing a reusable water bottle is encouraged. We
      will also have snacks available and Friday is Pizza day provided by the program so no cold lunch is needed on that day, unless your child does not eat pizza. Please notify Michelle ahead of time if your child has any food allergies.
    </p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion-odd">Do you offer payment plans? </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p> Yes, contact Michelle to discuss further.
